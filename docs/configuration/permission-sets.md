# Permission Sets

We are implementing Role Based Access Control (RBAC) to make it easy to maintain and update permissions. We are defining _Permission Sets_ in FOLIO and assigning users one or more permission sets to grant them all the access they need. **We are not assigning individual permissions to individual users.**

For example a Branch Manager might have: `Library - General`, `Circulation - General`, `Circulation - Manager`, and `Reserves - General` to allow them all the various functions they need.
