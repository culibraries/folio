## Decision Outcome

EBSCO reports that we cannot have two catalogs with two sets of patron authentication methods go into one EDS instance. It only works with one catalog and one SAML SSO authentication method to authenticate patrons. That being the case, we are moving forward with sharing an instance of FOLIO with Law. Law will be a library in our configuration of FOLIO. As we share access to most purchased e-resources, we are moving to sharing the EBSCO KB/backend tools and a single EZProxy instance. We will be able to scope to Law resources. There will be some challenges associated with users and circulation policies but these seem to be something we can overcome. We will work on merging Lawâ€™s bibliographic and other records at the appropriate time. We also need to  investigate our current EZProxy contract with OCLC and better understand how to combine proxy instances.
